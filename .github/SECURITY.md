### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have information about a security issue, or vulnerability in this teler-waf package, and/or you are able to successfully execute such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and pop-up an alert in [our demo site](https://waf.teler.app), please do **NOT** file a public issue — instead, kindly send your report privately via the [vulnerability report form](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf/security/advisories/new) to our [official channels](https://security.kitabisa.com/#official-channels) as per our [security policy](https://security.kitabisa.com/).
